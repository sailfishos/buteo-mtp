/// \brief The Thumbnailer class provides methods to generate representative
/// samples
/// The Thumbnailer class is used within the fsstorage plugin to generate
/// representative samples for objects. The class has one public method that is
/// used to requests for a thumbnail. Upon successful completion of the request,
/// a thumbnailReady signal is emitted. Upon error, the class simply logs the
/// error (Error handling is not very important for the representative sample
/// MTP property). Internally, the class uses the DBUS service exposed by
/// tumbler (http://live.gnome.org/ThumbnailerSpec).
