///
/// The ObjectPropertyCache class caches object property values for objects in memory for faster access.
/// This prevents going to storage plug-in's and in turn to the db's used by various storage plug-in's. Since
/// object handles are unique across storages, the cache is maintained by the responder: it caches object property
/// values per object. Values are cached first either when a setObjectPropList/Value is called or a getObjectPropList/Value
/// is called for an object already on the responder. Future access to these properties fetches the values from cache. The
/// cache is updated when a property's value is modified. This class is a singleton.
