/// \brief The MTPContainer class provides interfaces to serialize/de-serialize a byte stream as per the MTP specification
///
/// The protocol layer should use the methods exposed by this class to (de-)serilaize the dataset inside within the data phase
/// of an MTP operation. The class also provides utility inline functions to read/write data in little endian (regardless of the
/// processor architecture) off a byte stream. The size of it's internal buffer should be provided as an estimate in it's constructor,
/// or by using the setBufferSize() method. The class will automatically reallocate the data buffer as needed. When used as a serializer,
/// the class also allocates, automatically, extra memory to hold the MTP header.
